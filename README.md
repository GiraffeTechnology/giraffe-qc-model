# Giraffe QC Model

AI-native quality control inference system for industrial procurement, with two coordinated deployment targets: an on-device Android Tablet app and a server-side QC model. Both share a strict no-fake-result policy and a common set of field/result conventions, so outputs from both ends remain comparable and auditable.

## Overview

|Target            |Model                   |Inference                                                |Network                       |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|Android Tablet App|Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-MNN|Local, via MNN runtime                                   |Fully offline                 |
|QC Model (Server) |Qwen3-VL-8B             |Local inference, with API fallback on capability overflow|Local-first, network on demand|

## Pad vs Server Edition

The system has two runtime editions. Both editions share the same sample
database, admin page, SKU API, standard photos, inspection requirements,
and detection points. They differ only in the Qwen model and whether
API/cloud inference is permitted.

| Component | Pad Edition (`padLocal`) | Server Edition (`server`) |
|---|---|---|
| Sample DB | Shared | Shared |
| Sample Admin Page | Shared | Shared |
| SKU API | Shared | Shared |
| Standard Photos | Shared | Shared |
| Inspection Requirements | Shared | Shared |
| Detection Points | Shared | Shared |
| Qwen Model | Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-MNN | Qwen3-VL-8B |
| Qwen API | Disabled | Allowed if configured |
| Cloud Inference | Disabled | Allowed if configured |
| Version suffix | `*-padLocal` | `*-server` |

Edition is selected by the `QC_RUNTIME_EDITION` environment variable
(`padLocal` or `server`). See `src/runtime/editions.py`.

## Status

### Android Tablet App

🔧 **In development** — MNN native inference scaffold in place; JNI wiring to MNN-android.aar is pending.

- Target model: **Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-MNN** (local MNN runtime, fully offline).
- JNI calls are scaffolded in Kotlin; `nativeRunInference()` is commented out pending AAR integration.
- Branch: `fix/android-pad-qwen3-vl-2b-mnn-final`
- Task spec: `CLAUDE_ANDROID_PAD_ITER4A_TASK.md`

### QC Model (Server)

Configured with **Qwen3-VL-8B** as the primary inference model.

- Runs locally by default.
- When local model confidence/capability is insufficient ("capability overflow") for a given case, the server falls back to a cloud API call to supplement the result.
- Cloud calls are a fallback path only — not the default inference route.

### QC Sample DB & Admin Page

- SKU catalog DB with standard photos, inspection requirements, and detection points.
- Android-compatible SKU search API at `/api/v1/sku/search`.
- Shared admin web UI at `/admin/samples` (FastAPI + Jinja2, no React).
- Photo upload (file) and URL/path registration both supported.
- Visual ROI editor for detection points (canvas drag-to-draw).
- Shared by Pad and Server editions.

## Why on-device, not server-side

Earlier designs for this project assumed local inference would run on
a separate backend node calling an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That
assumption was replaced: the product requirement is a **single APK,
installable by a normal user with no root and no separate server**,
running on mainstream Snapdragon-driven phones/pads. That constraint
rules out larger models (3B+ multimodal models take tens of seconds to
minutes even on flagship Snapdragon hardware with a dedicated mobile
inference engine) and points to a small (≤2B parameter), heavily
quantized model run through **MNN** (Alibaba's open-source mobile
inference engine), accepting that a model this size needs more
frequent escalation to human review or cloud fallback than a
server-grade model would.

This tradeoff is acceptable here because real QC inspections in this
product are narrow, single-SKU comparisons (one captured photo vs. that
SKU's known-good standard photo, checked against a short, predefined
QC point checklist) — not open-domain visual reasoning.

## Core Principles

- **No fake results.** The system never fabricates a pass/fail outcome.
- **No silent cloud fallback.** Cloud inference is only invoked on local capability overflow, and is never the default path.
- **No silent degradation.** If the Tablet app's MNN runtime is unavailable, the result must be explicitly marked `MNN pending` / `review_required` rather than defaulting to any pass/fail value.

## Architecture

```text
Android QC App (single APK, no root, no separate server required)
  ├── CameraX live camera, auto-capture with quality/stability gating
  ├── Local-first photo + metadata storage (Room)
  ├── On-device MNN runtime running Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-MNN
  ├── SKU matching: on-device MNN visual similarity (when ready), with manual fallback
  └── Result display, labeling which engine produced each result

giraffe-qc-model backend (this repo's Python service — optional for
an individual device's inspection to work; required for fleet-level
aggregation, reporting, and abcdYi integration)
  ├── FastAPI
  ├── SKU / standard photo / QC point / inspection data model
  ├── QC Sample Admin page (/admin/samples) — shared Pad + Server edition
  ├── DashScope/Qwen cloud fallback provider
  └── abcdYi-compatible asset registry APIs + events
```

Inference is the operative word for "on-device first": a device with
the model already provisioned can complete a full inspection with zero
network connectivity. The backend's role is aggregation and the cloud
fallback leg, not running the primary inspection.

The Android app module and its MNN integration live alongside this
backend (see `docs/ANDROID_QC_APP.md` for the current module layout);
check that doc for the authoritative path, since the Android side is
being developed in parallel and its structure may be ahead of what's
summarized here.

## Current state

This section is kept honest and current — updated as phases land rather
than letting it drift.

- [x] Phase 0 — repository audit complete; known prior issues (missing
  image paths defaulting to pass, standard photo overwrite, frozen
  settings at import time, silent failure-to-done transitions) were
  verified fixed in existing code.
- [x] QWEN inference schema, prompt builder, and parser (shared
  contract between on-device and cloud paths) implemented against
  simulated/mock providers.
- [x] Inspection router implemented with the on-device-first / fail-closed
  policy, including the `on_device_fail_is_final` guard (§4.5.4),
  exercised against mock on-device and cloud providers.
- [x] Cloud fallback (DashScope) integration implemented and
  end-to-end tested against a real DashScope API key.
- [x] `scripts/benchmark_mnn.sh` written: ADB-based on-device latency
  benchmark targeting Snapdragon 8 Gen / 8 GB RAM device, reporting
  p50/p95 against the 10-second-per-image budget.
- [x] Android app module Kotlin sources complete: `QwenInspector`,
  `QcPromptBuilder`, `QcResultParser`, `QwenInspectionRouter`,
  `MnnQwenInspector` scaffold (JNI stub), `MnnRuntimeLoader`,
  `ModelProvisioning`, `BenchmarkActivity`, `MainActivity`,
  `PadRuntimeGraph`, `PendingTargetDetector`, `AutoCaptureController`,
  `TaskSelectionController`, and SKU/camera subsystems.
- [x] Fake/mock test doubles (`FakeInspectors`, `MockTargetDetector`,
  `FakeSkuRepository`) live exclusively in `src/test` — no mock
  contamination in `src/main`.
- [x] §4.5.1–4.5.4 exhaustive branch coverage: every router decision
  path exercised with deterministic fakes.
- [x] Multi-tenant isolation (12 tests) verified: cross-tenant reads
  return 404 (not 403), listing endpoints never leak other tenants'
  data.
- [x] Never-convert-failure-to-pass invariant verified across all
  failure modes via parametrized tests.
- [x] Full Python test suite: **203 tests pass 5× consecutively**, 6
  Qwen integration tests skipped by default (require
  `RUN_QWEN_INTEGRATION=1` + real key).
- [x] Android unit tests: `AutoCaptureControllerTest` (10 tests),
  `TaskSelectionControllerTest` (6 tests), `PreviewBoxCalculationsTest`
  (5 tests) — all pass with `./gradlew :app:testPadLocalDebugUnitTest`.
- [x] QC Sample DB + SKU API implemented: `qc_sku_items`,
  `qc_standard_photos`, `qc_inspection_requirements`,
  `qc_detection_points` models; `/api/v1/sku/search` and
  `/api/v1/sku/{sku_id}` endpoints; Android-compatible response shape.
- [x] Shared QC Sample Admin UI at `/admin/samples`: create SKU,
  upload or register photos, set primary photo, add requirements,
  draw ROI detection points with visual canvas editor, archive SKU.
  Shared by Pad and Server editions.
- [x] Pad vs Server edition config (`src/runtime/editions.py`):
  `QC_RUNTIME_EDITION=padLocal|server` with per-edition defaults for
  model name, Qwen API, and cloud inference.
- [x] DB integrity: unique `(tenant_id, item_number)` constraint with
  409 API response on duplicate; primary photo clearing filtered by
  both `sku_id` and `tenant_id`.
- [ ] Real on-device MNN inference not yet confirmed — JNI native
  integration is scaffolded but `nativeRunInference()` is not yet
  wired to the MNN AAR. Status will be updated once a physical
  Snapdragon test device validates the JNI path.
- [ ] Android app physical device validation pending.

## Next milestone

Once a physical Snapdragon test device is available (target: Snapdragon
8 Gen, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB storage):

1. Provision the **Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-MNN** model on the device per
   `docs/DEPLOYMENT_LOCAL_QWEN.md`.
1. Run `./scripts/benchmark_mnn.sh` against it and record p50/p95
   latency, cold-start time, and peak memory.
1. If the 10-second-per-image budget is met, replace the
   `MnnQwenInspector` stub with the real JNI-backed implementation.
   If it is not met, do not relax the budget silently — report the
   measured numbers and choose a mitigation (smaller/more quantized
   model, reduced input resolution, or a narrower per-call scope)
   before proceeding.
1. Install the APK on the physical device and validate the full
   capture-to-result flow end-to-end, offline.

## Development setup

### Quick start

```bash
# Install runtime + dev tooling
make sync-dev          # or: uv sync --group dev

# Run the full test suite once
make test              # or: uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run 5× consecutively (required before declaring a change done)
make test5
```

> **Do not use bare `uv sync` before running tests.** Plain `uv sync`
> installs only runtime dependencies and will silently remove pytest
> from the virtual environment. Always use `uv sync --group dev`
> (or `make sync-dev`) when you need to run the test suite.

### Android

```bash
# Create MNN stubs for CI (no real AAR needed)
bash scripts/download_mnn_android_libs.sh --ci-stubs

# Build padLocal debug APK + run unit tests
cd apps/android-qc && ./gradlew :app:assemblePadLocalDebug :app:testPadLocalDebugUnitTest
```

### QC Sample Admin UI

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/samples
```

### Qwen cloud integration tests (opt-in)

The Qwen real-API integration tests are **skipped by default** unless all
of the following environment variables are set:

| Variable | Required value |
|----------|---------------|
| `RUN_QWEN_INTEGRATION` | `1` |
| `QC_ENGINE_MODE` | `cloud_qwen_dev` |
| `LLM_ENABLE_REAL_CALLS` | `true` |
| `QWEN_CLOUD_ENABLED` | `true` |
| `ALLOW_SEND_IMAGES_TO_CLOUD_QWEN` | `true` |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or `QWEN_API_KEY` | real key |

## Development principles

A few project-wide rules worth knowing before contributing:

- **Never commit model weights or other large binary model artifacts**
  into this repository's normal git history. Model provisioning is a
  documented, scripted fetch (bundled at build time or sideloaded) —
  see `docs/DEPLOYMENT_LOCAL_QWEN.md`.
- **Never commit uploaded sample images.** The `data/qc_samples/`
  directory is listed in `.gitignore`. Only metadata is stored in the DB.
- **Mock everything expensive in tests.** Unit/CI tests must never call
  the real MNN model or the real DashScope API. Use the deterministic
  fake providers/inspectors (`FakeOnDeviceQwenInspector`,
  `TimeoutOnDeviceQwenInspector`, `InvalidJsonOnDeviceQwenInspector`,
  `NotProvisionedOnDeviceQwenInspector`, and their Python-side
  equivalents for the cloud provider). All fakes live in `src/test`.
- **A failing test is a defect, not something to retry past.** The test
  suite is run 5 consecutive times before a change is considered done;
  a failure on any run stops the loop and gets reported, not silently
  re-run until it happens to pass.
- **Multi-tenant isolation is a hard requirement,** not an
  afterthought — any new endpoint or query touching `ProductStandard`,
  `StandardPhoto`, `QCPoint`, `CapturePhoto`, `InspectionRun`, or
  `QCAsset` must be covered by a cross-tenant-access-denied test.
- **Do not call Qwen API or DashScope from the Pad QC inference path.**
  Cloud inference is not permitted on the Pad app — all pad-side QC
  inference must use the local MNN runtime.
- **The sample DB and admin page are edition-agnostic.** No admin or
  sample-catalog code may branch by `QC_RUNTIME_EDITION`. Only
  inference behaviour may differ per edition.

# Giraffe QC Model

> **Android Pad Branch (`android-pad-app`)** — This branch implements the
> offline-only Android Pad build. The Pad app uses on-device
> Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-MNN (MNN runtime) exclusively. There is **no cloud
> inference path, no DashScope call, and no Qwen API call** on this branch.
> If local MNN inference is not ready, the result is always `review_required`.
> See [`docs/ANDROID_PAD_LOCAL_ONLY.md`](docs/ANDROID_PAD_LOCAL_ONLY.md).

On-device-first visual quality-control product for Giraffe Technology's
apparel/textile QC workflows. A QC operator captures a photo on an
Android phone or pad; the device compares it against that SKU's
standard reference photo using a small Qwen vision-language model
running **on the device itself**. Uncertain results are
never silently treated as a pass.

> **Status: active development.** This README describes the target
> architecture and the current state as of the last update. Some
> components are implemented against simulated/mock inference; others
> are still in progress. See [Current state](#current-state) below
> before assuming any specific module is production-ready.

## Why on-device, not server-side

Earlier designs for this project assumed local inference would run on
a separate backend node calling an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That
assumption was replaced: the product requirement is a **single APK,
installable by a normal user with no root and no separate server**,
running on mainstream Snapdragon-driven phones/pads. That constraint
rules out larger models and points to a small, heavily
quantized model run through **MNN** (Alibaba's open-source mobile
inference engine), accepting that a model this size needs more
frequent escalation to human review than a server-grade model would.

This tradeoff is acceptable here because real QC inspections in this
product are narrow, single-SKU comparisons (one captured photo vs. that
SKU's known-good standard photo, checked against a short, predefined
QC point checklist) — not open-domain visual reasoning.

## Core safety principle

The single rule every module in this repository is built around:

> **Uncertainty must surface as `review_required`, never silently
> resolve to `pass`.**

This applies whether the uncertainty comes from a missing image, an
unparseable model response, an unrecognized QC point, an on-device
timeout, a provisioning error, or anything else. No code path
should convert "we don't know" into "it's fine."

## Architecture

```text
Android QC App (single APK, no root, no separate server required)
  ├── CameraX live camera, auto-capture with quality/stability gating
  ├── Local-first photo + metadata storage (Room)
  ├── On-device MNN runtime running Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-MNN
  ├── Inspection router: local-only (no cloud path on Android Pad)
  └── Result display, showing engine/mode/status

giraffe-qc-model backend (this repo's Python service — optional for
an individual device's inspection to work; required for fleet-level
aggregation, reporting, and abcdYi integration)
  ├── FastAPI
  ├── SKU / standard photo / QC point / inspection data model
  ├── Backend aggregation provider (cloud inference not active on Android Pad)
  └── abcdYi-compatible asset registry APIs + events
```

Inference is the operative word for "on-device first": a device with
the model already provisioned can complete a full inspection with zero
network connectivity. The backend's role is aggregation, not running
the primary inspection.

The Android app module and its MNN integration live alongside this
backend (see `docs/ANDROID_QC_APP.md` for the current module layout);
check that doc for the authoritative path, since the Android side is
being developed in parallel and its structure may be ahead of what's
summarized here.

## Current state

This section should be kept honest and current — update it as phases
land rather than letting it drift.

- [x] Phase 0 — repository audit complete; known prior issues (missing
  image paths defaulting to pass, standard photo overwrite, frozen
  settings at import time, silent failure-to-done transitions) were
  verified fixed in existing code.
- [x] QWEN inference schema, prompt builder, and parser (shared
  contract between on-device and cloud paths) implemented against
  simulated/mock providers.
- [x] Inspection router implemented with the on-device-first / fail-closed
  policy, including the `on_device_fail_is_final` guard (§4.5.4),
  exercised against mock on-device and cloud providers.
- [x] Android Pad branch: local-only router enforced; all uncertain/failed
  results return `review_required`; no cloud inference path exists on this branch.
- [x] `scripts/benchmark_mnn.sh` written: ADB-based on-device latency
  benchmark targeting Snapdragon 8 Gen / 8 GB RAM device, reporting
  p50/p95 against the 10-second-per-image budget.
- [x] Android app module complete (simulated environment): all Kotlin
  source files written (`QwenInspector`, `QcPromptBuilder`,
  `QcResultParser`, `QwenInspectionRouter`, `MnnQwenInspector` scaffold,
  `MnnRuntimeLoader`, `ModelProvisioning`, `FakeInspectors`,
  `BenchmarkActivity`, `MainActivity`); 4 Kotlin JVM test files, 38
  test cases, runnable without a device.
- [x] §4.5.1–4.5.4 exhaustive branch coverage: every router decision
  path (on-device accept, timeout, parse failure, low confidence,
  on-device fail-is-final, cloud disabled, no provider, model not
  provisioned, double failure) exercised with deterministic fakes.
- [x] Multi-tenant isolation (12 tests) verified: cross-tenant reads
  return 404 (not 403), listing endpoints never leak other tenants'
  data.
- [x] Never-convert-failure-to-pass invariant verified across all
  failure modes via parametrized tests.
- [x] Full Python test suite: **203 tests pass 5× consecutively**, 6
  Qwen integration tests skipped by default (require
  `RUN_QWEN_INTEGRATION=1` + real key).
- [ ] **Real on-device MNN benchmark not yet run.** The on-device
  inspector (`MnnQwenInspector`) is currently a stub; the real
  `nativeRunInference()` JNI call against an MNN-converted model
  (Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-MNN) has not been exercised on physical
  hardware. This is the next concrete milestone — see
  [Next milestone](#next-milestone).
- [ ] Android app has not yet been installed and run on a physical
  device. The capture → on-device-inspect → router → result-display
  flow has been validated in a simulated environment only.

## Next milestone

Once a physical Snapdragon test device is available (target: Snapdragon
8 Gen, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB storage):

1. Provision the Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-MNN model on the device per
   `docs/PAD_LOCAL_MNN_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
1. Run `./scripts/benchmark_mnn.sh` against it and record p50/p95
   latency, cold-start time, and peak memory.
1. If the 10-second-per-image budget is met, replace the
   `MnnQwenInspector` stub with the real JNI-backed implementation.
   If it is not met, do not relax the budget silently — report the
   measured numbers and choose a mitigation (smaller/more quantized
   model, reduced input resolution, or a narrower per-call scope)
   before proceeding.
1. Install the APK on the physical device and validate the full
   capture-to-result flow end-to-end, offline.

## Development setup

### Quick start

```bash
# Install runtime + dev tooling
make sync-dev          # or: uv sync --group dev

# Run the full test suite once
make test              # or: uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run 5× consecutively (required before declaring a change done)
make test5
```

> **Do not use bare `uv sync` before running tests.** Plain `uv sync`
> installs only runtime dependencies and will silently remove pytest
> from the virtual environment. Always use `uv sync --group dev`
> (or `make sync-dev`) when you need to run the test suite.

### Equivalent direct commands

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Qwen cloud integration tests (opt-in)

The Qwen real-API integration tests are **skipped by default** unless all
of the following environment variables are set:

| Variable | Required value |
|----------|---------------|
| `RUN_QWEN_INTEGRATION` | `1` |
| `QC_ENGINE_MODE` | `cloud_qwen_dev` |
| `LLM_ENABLE_REAL_CALLS` | `true` |
| `QWEN_CLOUD_ENABLED` | `true` |
| `ALLOW_SEND_IMAGES_TO_CLOUD_QWEN` | `true` |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or `QWEN_API_KEY` | real key |

Skipped integration tests are **expected and correct** in normal CI runs.

To run them manually:

```bash
RUN_QWEN_INTEGRATION=1 \
QC_ENGINE_MODE=cloud_qwen_dev \
LLM_ENABLE_REAL_CALLS=true \
QWEN_CLOUD_ENABLED=true \
ALLOW_SEND_IMAGES_TO_CLOUD_QWEN=true \
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="$DASHSCOPE_API_KEY" \
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

Or via Makefile (omits the key — set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` in your shell first):

```bash
make test-qwen
```

The `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` / `QWEN_API_KEY` is a runtime-only secret.
It must never be committed to this repository.

## Development principles

A few project-wide rules worth knowing before contributing:

- **Never commit model weights or other large binary model artifacts**
  into this repository's normal git history. Model provisioning is a
  documented, scripted sideload (via `adb push`) and checksum-verified
  on device — see `docs/PAD_LOCAL_MNN_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **Mock everything expensive in tests.** Unit/CI tests must never call
  the real MNN model or the real DashScope API. Use the deterministic
  fake providers/inspectors (`FakeOnDeviceQwenInspector`,
  `TimeoutOnDeviceQwenInspector`, `InvalidJsonOnDeviceQwenInspector`,
  `NotProvisionedOnDeviceQwenInspector`, and their Python-side
  equivalents for the cloud provider).
- **A failing test is a defect, not something to retry past.** The test
  suite is run 5 consecutive times before a change is considered done;
  a failure on any run stops the loop and gets reported, not silently
  re-run until it happens to pass.
- **Multi-tenant isolation is a hard requirement,** not an
  afterthought — any new endpoint or query touching `ProductStandard`,
  `StandardPhoto`, `QCPoint`, `CapturePhoto`, `InspectionRun`, or
  `QCAsset` must be covered by a cross-tenant-access-denied test.
- **This branch (`android-pad-app`) is not merged to `main`
  autonomously.** Merges happen after explicit human review.
